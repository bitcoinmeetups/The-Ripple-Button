The Ripple Button
=================

The Ripple Button - Embeddable button for any type of website. Links directly to the Ripple trade page (orders).

The button is customizable and the embed code will be automatically generated after you fill out a form on the ripple button website (or Ripple.com itself if they want to make this a core feature).

Form fields
===========

-Base currency/issuer
-Counter currency/issuer
-Link to contract
-Other

Why?
====

To make it easy for website owners to link to their own tokens trading page.

How?
====

The Ripple URI needs to be slightly modified to allow creation of unique URL's and let anyone access a trading page/order book without signing in first (visitors can see the orders but they cannot buy/sell without signing in).

When?
=====

This feature should be released as soon as possible because it would allow millions of website owners to link directly to something potentially more lucrative and relevant than ads or affiliate programs.
